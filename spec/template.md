# *Title*

*Short description of the program*

## Implementation

*An outline of what implementations will need to do to fulfill the specification.*
*Try to find a balance between ensuring implementors know what they need to do while not restricting them to one method.*
* *Specific implementation details (as opposed to higher-level descriptions) should be kept in lists*

*This is to prevent widely different - or even incorrect - implementations from being written.*

**Implemented in**: *(List of languages this is currently implemented in)*

**To be implemented in**: *(List of languages that this currently **isn't** implemented in, but can and should be.)*
