# *Title*

*Short description of the program*

## Implementation

### Functions *(Optional)*

- List of functions used in the specification.

### Code

Pseudocode using a C-like structure in

```
fenced code blocks
```

outlining the operations an implementation should perform to fulfull the specification.

Specific restrictions:
- Variables and functions should be named in snake_case.
- Any linebreaks in printed output must be explicitly included. (\n)
- The number of arguments given to the program and their values must be retrieved from the argc and argv[] variables respectively.
- Blocks of code - i.e. after an if statement - must be wrapped in {}.

and, if needed

> blockquotes

Containing higher-level explanations of *why* those operations are performed etc.

These should include anything that would otherwise be placed in a comment in the source code.

**Implemented in**: *Comma-separated list of languages this is currently implemented in*

**To be implemented in**: *Comma-separated list of languages that this currently **isn't** implemented in, but can and should be.*
