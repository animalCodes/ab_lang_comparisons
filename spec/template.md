Pseudocode using a C-like structure in

```

outlining the operations an implementation should perform to fulfull the specification.

- Any linebreaks in printed output must be explicitly included. (\n)
- Blocks of code - i.e. after an if statement - must be wrapped in {}.

and, if needed

> blockquotes

Containing higher-level explanations of *why* those operations are performed etc.

These should include anything that would otherwise be placed in a comment in the source code.

**Implemented in**: *Comma-separated list of languages this is currently implemented in*

**To be implemented in**: *Comma-separated list of languages that this currently **isn't** implemented in, but can and should be.*
