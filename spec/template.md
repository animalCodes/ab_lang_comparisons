# Template specification

Short paragraph(s) describing the program

## Implementation

* A series of steps the program should perform to fulfill the specification.
    * Just an example method, not **the** way to implement it.

* The primary use of this section is to help developers understand *how* to implement a specification, otherwise implementations that don't actually fulfill the requirements could be written.

* Can be as long or short as required.

**Implemented in**: (List of languages this is currently implemented in)

**To be implemented in**: (List of languages that this currently *isn't* implemented in, but can and should be.)
