# FizzBuzz

Emulate the game 'Fizzbuzz' the rules of which are essentially: 

Count up from 1, if the number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead of the number, if the number is divisible by 5, say "Buzz". If the number is divisible by 3 *and* 5, say "FizzBuzz".

**Showcases**: Simple branching, getting remainders, string concatenation.

* Receives input on execution
    * If no input is received, notify user and terminate program.

* If needed, convert input to a number
    * If input cannot be converted to a number for whatever reason, notify user and terminate program.

* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

* If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz"

* Otherwise, print the number.

**Implemented in**: C, C++, C#, denoJS, Go, Java, Kotlin, Node.js, Ruby, Rust.
